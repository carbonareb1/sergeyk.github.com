    Undergrad research project with [Steve Seitz][ss].
    With our application, the user can zoom in on a distant landmark using other peopleâ€™s photographs.
    Our system relies on a 3D scene modeling back end that computes the viewpoint of each photograph in an unordered large photo collection.
